# Introduction

## Motivation
Car manufactures want to reduce cost in terms of money and time required to develop, test and validate  a new piece of software due to a change of supplier. 
For that reason, centralized end-to-end architectures are the solution they are aiming to, because for car companies such as BWW and Audi the car of future will be similar to a "data center on wheels" [@Hansen2019]. 

Centralized end-to-end architectures would be the first step stone toward to decoupling software and hardware [@Future2019].
This type of architectures not only will take advantage of  internet connectivity, cloud computing and powerful heterogeneous processing units, but also will allow scalable, hierarchical and highly integrated system.

In other words, car manufactures prefer now a days low-latency, hierarchical and cost effectiveness of centralized end-to-end architectures, because today requirements of computational power,  bandwidth, integration, safety and real-time [@Kanajan2006]. 

However, car manufactures don't forget that at the end, in centralized end-to-end architectures, different types of software would run on top of an heterogeneous hardware supplied by companies such as NVIDIA, Mobileye or Qualcomm.
Thus, it's important to analyze and understand how software will behave under those conditions, in order to ensure a predictable and efficient system.
