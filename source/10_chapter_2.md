## NVIDIA GPU Software Model
Now a days computer applications run on heterogeneous hardware and GPUs are important in order to achieve high performance computing. 
Since 2006 running software on NVIDIA GPUs are known as a _CUDA application_ [@CUDAZONE2019].
A CUDA application will run concurrently multiple instances of special functions called **kernels**.Each instance runs on a **thread**. 
Moreover, these threads are arranged in **blocks**, and blocks compose **grids** as shown in Figure \ref{img:sw_model_grids}. 

![Organisation of grids, blocks, threads, and kernels [@CCUDA2010]. \label{img:sw_model_grids} ](source/figures/sw_model_grids.png){width=60%}

It's logical to think that there is also a hierarchical memory structure. 
Threads, blocks and grids have access to different memory spaces as ilustrated in Figure \ref{img:sw_model_memory}.
The types of memory are summarized in Table \ref{tab:memory_hierarchy}.

In summary, CUDA application solve problems that were modeled based on _divide and conquer_ principle. Moreover, CUDA software model not only allow users to achieve high computational performance, but also CUDA application are highly scalable. 


## NVIDIA GPU Hardware Model
The CUDA architecture is based on **Streaming Multiprocessors** (SM) which perform the actual computation.
Each SM has it own control units, registers, execution pipelines and local memories, but they also have access to global memory as ilustrated in Figure \ref{img:sm_memory}.
A **stream** is a queue of CUDA operations, memory copy and kernel launch.
We will talk more about streams in following sections.

![Memory hierarchy  \label{img:sm_memory} ](source/figures/sm_memory.png){width=60%}


When a kernel grid is launch blocks are enumerated and assigend to the SMs. 
Once the blocks are assigned, threads are managed in **wraps** by the **wrap scheduler**. A wraps is a group of 32 threads that run in parallel. 
Thus, it's highly recommendable to use block sizes of size $32N, N \in \mathbb{N}$, otherwise there would be "inactive" threads.
A example is shown in Figure \ref{img:inactive_thread}, where there is a block of 140 threads but since the wrap scheduler works with wraps, 20 threads are wasted and no other block can make use of them.

The amount of  threads and blocks that can run concurrently per SM depends on the number of 32-bit registers and shared memory within SM, as well as the CUDA computing capability of the GPU. Information related to maximum amount of blocks  or threads, as well as the computing capability of the GPU can be display executing `deviceQuery` tool. 
Some information about Jetson TX2 is presented below:

## NVIDIA processors inside Jetson TX2

### NVIDIA Denver2
The other ARM cluster is composed of  two NVIDIA Denver2 cores and 2MB of L2 Cache.
Each NVIDIA Denver2 is a custom made 64-bit processing  based on ARMv8, which is optimized for  single-thread performance [@Denver2019url]. 

![Diagram of the Denver Cluster in TX2 \label{img:denver_arch} ](source/figures/denver_arch.png){width=100%}


This custom processor has two main characteristics. First, it has a 7-way superscalar microarchitecture.
It means that a Denver2 core can process 7 operations per clock cycle.
Secondly, it uses _Dynamic Code Optimization_. 
Frequently used software routines are converted into a dense and highly tunned equivalent microcode executable only by Denver2 cores. 
A Denver2 core analyze the ARM code just before execution and look for places where instructions can be handle together to maximize throughput taking in advantage the 7-way superscalar microarchitecture. 
In Figure \ref{img:denver_arch} can be observed that each Denver2 core has  64KB of L1 Data Cache, and  128KB of Instruction Cache. 
The optimized code is stored in the former one, also known as _Optimization Cache_ [@Denver2019url].
