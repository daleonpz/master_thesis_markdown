<!-- This is the abstract -->

The purpose of the thesis is to develop a response time algorithm for AMALTHEA-based models to analyze timming behaviors  of CUDA kernels on NVIDIA Jetson TX2's GPU. 
This work was developed on the context of Bosch WATERS Challenge 2019. The challenge focuses on timing-analysis for heterogeneous software-hardware systems based on centralized end-to-end architectures, and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 was the selected platform for testing. 
Furthermore, key concepts related to NVIDIA's GPU architecture are presented, as well as a detailed explanation of rules behind platform's GPU scheduler.

Our algorithm is based on these rules and our experimental result shows the accuracy of our algorithm to estimate completion times for kernels executed on Jetson TX2 platform. Real timming data from NVIDIA's platform was used in our experiments.
Moreover, we implemented our algorithm on Eclipse APP4MC, which allows AMALTHEA-based response time analysis for NVIDIA's Jetson TX2.
